Modern [UE4 / Blueprint] potential "spiritual successor" to Joust.

Developed in an attempt to master UE4's blueprint system (which I didn't -- see [KotLT](https://github.com/stained/KotLT) for a, mostly rebuilt C++ version). 

Feel free to scavange [placeholder] content and/or code if you find it useful.
